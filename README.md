# Totorrent: A Fluffy and Neighbourly Bittorrent Client
This is a WIP bittorrent client I've been working on for a couple of months. I think it's in a very clean stage now, but it still can't be used in the wild. I'll continue fixing the issues slowly.

I'll do a proper README with more features when the project is done.

# Testing
`go test ./...`


All test functions postfixed with `_Online` work on **real** peers in the wild: use with discretion.
